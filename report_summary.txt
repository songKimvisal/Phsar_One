**Functions Implemented:**

*   **Font-Based Language Switching:** The `ThemedText.tsx` component was enhanced to dynamically apply specific fonts (`khmer-regular` or `Oxygen`) based on the active language (`kh` or `en`), centralizing font control.
*   **`ThemedTextInput` Component:** A new, reusable `src/components/ThemedTextInput.tsx` component was developed. It extends the native `TextInput` to automatically apply themed fonts and `placeholderTextColor` based on language and theme.

**Problems Fixed:**

*   **Inconsistent Font Application:** Previously, fonts were applied inconsistently across various text elements. This was fixed by centralizing font logic within `ThemedText` and `ThemedTextInput`.
*   **Lack of Reusable Themed Input:** The absence of a dedicated themed input component led to repetitive code for applying themes and fonts to `TextInput` elements. This was solved by creating `ThemedTextInput`.
*   **Redundant Font Declarations:** `activeFont` variables and explicit `fontFamily` styles were repetitively declared in many components (`ProductCategory.tsx`, `app/sell/details.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`), leading to bloated and less maintainable code. These redundancies were eliminated.
*   **Usage of Native Text/TextInput:** Several components were using native `Text` or `TextInput` directly without theme integration. These were refactored to use `ThemedText` and `ThemedTextInput` for consistent theming.
*   **Incorrect Import Paths:** Invalid import paths (e.g., `@/src/` instead of `@src/`) were corrected in multiple tab screen files (`app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/sell.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/trade.tsx`, and `app/sell/_layout.tsx`), resolving module resolution issues.
*   **Streamlined Code Structure:** By centralizing font and theming logic, the overall codebase became cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain.
*   **Version Control Management:** All changes were systematically committed and pushed to the GitHub repository through a series of logical, atomic commits, ensuring proper version control and a clear development history.
