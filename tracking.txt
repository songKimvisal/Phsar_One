**Work Summary (January 20, 2026 - Present)**

This document outlines the major tasks completed since yesterday, focusing on improvements to the application's theming, font management, and code structure.

1.  **Implemented Font-Based Language Switching:**
    *   Ensured the `ThemedText.tsx` component correctly applies specific fonts (`khmer-regular` for Khmer, `Oxygen` for other languages) based on the active `i18n.language` setting. This centralizes font control and ensures consistency across the application.

2.  **Created `ThemedTextInput` Component:**
    *   Developed a new, reusable `src/components/ThemedTextInput.tsx` component. This component extends the native `TextInput` but automatically applies the correct themed font and `placeholderTextColor` based on the active language and theme, promoting code reusability and consistent UI.

3.  **Refactored Existing Components for Theming Consistency:**
    *   **`src/components/Header.tsx`**: Updated the logo text to use `ThemedText` instead of the native `Text` component, ensuring it respects the global font and theme settings.
    *   **`src/components/ProductCategory.tsx`**: Removed redundant `activeFont` declarations and explicit `fontFamily` styles from `ThemedText` instances. The component now relies entirely on `ThemedText`'s internal logic for font application, simplifying the code.
    *   **`src/components/SearchBar.tsx`**: Replaced the native `TextInput` with the newly created `ThemedTextInput` component, eliminating the need for manual font and placeholder color application within `SearchBar.tsx`.
    *   **`app/sell/details.tsx`**: Replaced native `TextInput` fields with `ThemedTextInput`. Also, removed redundant `activeFont` variables and `fontFamily` styles from `ThemedText` instances, streamlining the component's styling.
    *   **`app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/sell.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/trade.tsx`**: Corrected invalid import paths from `@/src/` to `@src/`, ensuring proper module resolution.
    *   **`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`**: Eliminated redundant `activeFont` declarations and `fontFamily` styles from `ThemedText` components, centralizing font management within `ThemedText` itself.

4.  **Version Control Operations (Git):**
    *   All changes were committed and pushed to the GitHub repository using a series of logical, atomic commits to maintain a clean and descriptive git history.
    *   Successfully managed additional modified and previously untracked files by staging and committing them in a final commit, as per user instruction.

The application's text and input fields now consistently adhere to the defined theming and language-specific font rules, improving both user experience and code maintainability.
